				cookie parser

A cookie is a key-value pair that is stored in the browser. The browser attaches cookies to every HTTP request that is sent to the server.

In a cookie, you canâ€™t store a lot of data. A cookie cannot store any sort of user credentials or secret information. If we did that, a hacker could easily get hold of that information and steal personal data for malicious activities.


					session
					
On the other hand, the session data is stored on the server-side, i.e., a database or a session store. Hence, it can accommodate larger amounts of data. To access data from the server-side, a session is authenticated with a secret key or a session id that we get from the cookie on every request.


					const http = require('http');
					
					
Node. js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node. js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). To include the HTTP module, use the require() method: var http = require('http');



					

					crypto
					
Crypto is a module in Node. js which deals with an algorithm that performs data encryption and decryption. 

					SHA256
					
SHA-256 stands for Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit and it's used for cryptographic security. Cryptographic hash algorithms produce irreversible and unique hashes. The larger the number of possible hashes, the smaller the chance that two values will create the same hash.
